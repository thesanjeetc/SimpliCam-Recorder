# SimpliCam Recorder

A Selenium bot which monitors the [SimpliCam](https://simplisafe.co.uk/simplicam-security-camera) video stream in real-time, via the dashboard. When motion is detected, it starts recording for 10 minutes and automatically uploads the footage to Google Drive. This method allows you to maintain control of your own data, without paying for the monthly plan. Deployed on Heroku for continuous monitoring.
